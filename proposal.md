_A brief sentence or two with links to data sources._
[This](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/wuhan-coronavirus-a-geographical-analysis/notebook) is the dataset that I will be using. As this is an ongoing problem currently, this dataset would be useful for raising awareness around the world for people who are around the world to see whether other countries are affected by coronavirus and whether there is a the virus in the country they currently live in.

_A couple of sentences on why you need datavis to answer your research questions._
I have decided to take the inspiration from the insights as I think it will be interesting to see the results in different types of data in a structured format in different types of charts and graphs so that it is easier to process the data. I think datavis will be able to answer the research questions that I have as it will allow me to compare the amount of cases that there has been overall as well as see the overall difference the coronavirus has made to the way we live in a world where this is an unknown virus to everyone. It will also allow us to see whether something has been done in order to solve what exactly the virus is and what it is doing to a humans body. There are a variety of things that play a part in this dataset.
